	This mod adds a new pack of genes that change the gender ratio of that xenotype
	
	
Note from the porter: this great mod was made by Tuarre, all I (CTH2004) did was change a few things, and upload the port with permision.
Note from the porter 2: if you are using this mod, do not, I repeat, do not, use it with the original. The ID's are the same to allow for cross-compatibality, meaning youll have duplicates and errors galore!
Note from the porter 3: as this is a 1-for-1 port, I will only be fixing any bugs/ updateing to new versions. I do have plans (and permision) to integrate it with my mod, and there new features shall abound!
