This mod is a direct, 1-1 port of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3089173425]Gender Ratio Genes[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051307062/myworkshopfiles/]Tuarre[/url]

To quote the mods description: [quote]
The following mod adds:
Several genes that change the ratio of males and females in a genotype. This way, you could have different genotypes with more females and others with fewer.

This is my first mod, hopefully, it works well. Despite that, I've been using this mod for a long time. I didn't upload it because, to be honest, I didn't have time to organize it better, so based on experience, it shouldn't fail. P.S.: The mod's cover was made with artificial intelligence

To modders.
You can use my mod as a requirement.

All I did was (with permision) do a few minor changes so it's 1.5 compatible, and a few minor improvments.
Since this is a 1 to 1 port, all I will be doing is fixing bugs and updateing it (well, and 1 minor addition). I do have semi-long-term plans (and permision to with credit) use parts of this in another mod, and that one will have more features!

Also, do note, I kept the mod ID the same for compat. because of that, [i]do not[/i] I repeat, [i]do not[/i] keep this mod [i]and[/i] the original! You will get errors and duplicates galore!

Finally, just so ya'll know, if you install [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1660622094]Tabula Rausa[/url], then there will be an in-built changelog!
