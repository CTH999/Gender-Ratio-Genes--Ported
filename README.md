This mod as an almost 1-for-1 port of this one: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3089173425


original description: 
The following mod adds:
Several genes that change the ratio of males and females in a genotype. This way, you could have different genotypes with more females and others with fewer.

This is my first mod, hopefully, it works well. Despite that, I've been using this mod for a long time. I didn't upload it because, to be honest, I didn't have time to organize it better, so based on experience, it shouldn't fail. P.S.: The mod's cover was made with artificial intelligence

To modders.
You can use my mod as a requirement.
