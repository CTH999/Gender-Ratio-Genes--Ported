# What is this?
This mod is a nearly 1 for 1 port of a personal favorite mod of mine, [Gender Ratio Genes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3089173425) by [Tuarre](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051307062/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100) mod as an almost 1-for-1 port of this one: 
## What does it do
Wonderful question! I'll let the mods original description tell you: 

>The following mod adds:
>Several genes that change the ratio of males and females in a genotype. This way, you could have different genotypes with more females and others with fewer.
>
>This is my first mod, hopefully, it works well. Despite that, I've been using this mod for a long time. I didn't upload it because, to be honest, I didn't have time to organize it better, so based on experience, it shouldn't fail. P.S.: The mod's cover was made with artificial intelligence
>
>To modders.
>You can use my mod as a requirement.
# Warnings
1. as this is a 1 for 1 port, new genes and such shan't be added. A long term plan is to integrate it with my main mod, but that's medium-term
2. to prevent incompatibility, I kept all ID's the same. that means haveing both mods downloaded can cause issues
